This project is divide in 2 parts. One with an user interface where you can test the quality	of the facial recognition. ( you save your face, software learn it ( average face ) , and live recognition). 
And the other part is without user interface, if you want to adapt our recognition face security in your project ( it came a website, or a program in c++ …)
